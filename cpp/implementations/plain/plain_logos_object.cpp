// DeadlineService — the clock the per-call deadlines hang off. ONE thread for
// the whole process, and deliberately NOT the one the connections run on.
//
// WHY IT IS SEPARATE, which is the single most important decision in this file.
// Folding the per-call waiter thread away means the deadline has to live
// somewhere else, and the obvious somewhere — the connection's own strand, on
// IoContextPool::shared() — makes every deadline in the process hostage to that
// one io thread. It is not a theoretical hostage: this transport delivers user
// onEvent callbacks INLINE on the io thread (rpc_connection.h dispatchIncoming),
// and an event handler that calls another module is ordinary module code. A
// handler making a 2000ms synchronous call while a 200ms deadline is outstanding
// on a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT connection made that deadline fire at 2003ms;
// measured, and the reason this class exists. With the ambient timeouts in this
// stack — 5s in getMethods, 30s in the deferred fallback — a 300ms deadline
// becomes multi-second, and a handler that blocks forever means the deadline
// never fires at all. The whole point of a timeout is that it is the thing that
// still works when everything else is stuck.
//
// The three alternatives, and why not:
//
//   * A SECOND io thread in IoContextPool. Does not fix it — user handlers are
//     unbounded, so N simultaneously-blocked handlers need N+1 threads, and the
//     count is not knowable. It would also quietly break every "serialized by
//     there being one thread" assumption in the transport, which is a far larger
//     blast radius than this class.
//   * MOVING INLINE EVENT DELIVERY OFF THE STRAND (post user callbacks to the
//     Qt loop). Correct direction, much bigger change: it alters event ordering
//     and re-entrancy for every existing consumer of this transport, and it does
//     not help a deadline while the Qt loop itself is blocked.
//   * A Qt TIMER on the Qt event loop. Strictly worse than either: a
//     synchronous callMethod issued from the Qt thread — the most ordinary thing
//     a module does — blocks that loop for the whole call, so the deadline would
//     be hostage to exactly the calls it is supposed to bound.
//
// So: one dedicated thread, process-wide, that does nothing but arm, cancel and
// fire timers. It restores the independence the per-call waiter threads had, at
// one thread instead of one per pending call, which is the entire point of the
// fold. Nothing else may ever be posted here; user code reaches the Qt loop via
// postDelivery, and AsyncCall::deliver() is a flag, two map erases and a
// post.

// DeliveryService — the thread user callbacks land on in a process that has NO
// Qt event loop. A THIRD singleton thread, and the reasons it is neither of the
// other two are the whole design.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. The delivery hop below used to be exactly this:
//
//     QCoreApplication* app = QCoreApplication::instance();
//     if (!app) return;                       // <- the callback, dropped
//
// In a Qt host that branch only fires after QCoreApplication is gone, i.e.
// during shutdown, which is why it read as a reasonable guard. In a host that
// never had one it fires for EVERY call, forever: callMethodAsyncWithError,
// lp_invoke_async and every generated async wrapper promise their callback
// exactly once, and the plain transport — the transport whose entire reason for
// existing is to work without Qt — delivered zero. Not an error, not a
// timeout: silence, which turns a bounded call into an unbounded wait in every
// caller that awaits it. The header's guarantee was unconditional and untrue.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT, which is the constraint that rules out the obvious fix.
// "Just call it inline when there is no loop" would run user code on whatever
// stack completed the call — the Asio read handler on the connection's strand,
// the deadline thread, or the middle of release(). That is the re-entrancy
// class this codebase has already paid for once: a deferred-multi completion
// running inline on the QtRO read stack, SIGSEGV, fixed by pushing it off the
// stack with QTimer::singleShot(0) (remote_transport.cpp). The whole point of
// this hop is that no user callback ever runs on an Asio handler stack, and a
// fix that delivers by removing the hop is not a fix.
//
// NOR IS IT THE DEADLINE THREAD. Posting user callbacks onto DeadlineService
// would make every deadline in the process hostage to user code — a callback
// that makes a synchronous call, or blocks, stops the clock for every other
// pending call. That is precisely the coupling DeadlineService was extracted to
// prevent, and its comment above says nothing else may ever be posted there.
// One thread each, therefore, and they cost nothing until used: a Qt host never
// starts this one at all.
//
// NOR IS IT "fail the call at issue time when there is no loop". That answer
// would make the plain transport unusable in exactly the deployment it was
// built for, and it still needs somewhere to deliver the failure it invents.
//
// ORDERING. A single thread draining a FIFO, so callbacks are delivered in the
// order they were resolved — the same property the Qt queued connection gives.
//
// AND IT IS NEVER DESTROYED, which is the one design decision in this class that
// is not obvious and is not free. The first cut made it an ordinary
// function-local static, and that is a use-after-free: a function-local static
// is constructed on FIRST DELIVERY, so anything with static storage that was
// constructed earlier — which is everything constructed before the first async
// call in the process — is destroyed LATER. Its destructor's delivery then posts
// into an io_context that has already run its own destructor, on a thread that
// has already been joined. Reproduced with nothing but the null-connection
// early-return path: three runs out of three, SIGSEGV under Guard Malloc inside
// scheduler::post_immediate_completion, reached from a static destructor through
// __cxa_finalize; and without Guard Malloc, silently, as delivered=0 — the very
// drop this class exists to fix, moved to a later moment.
//
// SO THE OBJECT OUTLIVES EVERY POSSIBLE CALLER, by never being destroyed at all
// and never registering a destructor to run. A deliberate, bounded leak: ONE
// io_context and ONE thread, in a process that is ending. What it buys is that
// postDelivery has no shutdown window — there is no state in which the vehicle
// is gone but callers remain — so a delivery issued from a static destructor
// after main() has returned still lands on a live delivery thread. Pinned by a
// probe that runs after main() in tests/protocol/test_delivery_without_qt.cpp.
//
// AND PROCESS EXIT MUST NOT WAIT FOR IT, which is why the thread is DETACHED
// rather than merely un-joined. exit() does not join threads, so an abandoned
// thread cannot hold the process open; detaching says so at the one place a
// future reader would otherwise reintroduce a join. Note what the old
// destructor's own comment was worried about — a user callback that blocks
// forever at static-destruction time hanging the join — and that this shape
// cannot have that failure at all, because there is no join. The hazard was
// always the reverse of what that comment described: the service died before its
// callers did.
//
// WHAT THE LEAK COSTS, stated rather than waved past. One thread lives from the
// first Qt-free async delivery to process exit, where it is sitting in the
// kernel waiting for work; and a callback that is RUNNING when the process exits
// can be cut off mid-flight, exactly as a Qt slot can be when the event loop's
// thread is torn down. What it cannot do is post into freed memory, which is
// what the alternative did.

// Hand `callback(result, err)` over to a LATER stack, so PlainLogosObject's
// async path matches LogosObject's interface contract: callbacks are never
// delivered synchronously inside the call that issued them, and never on the
// transport's io thread.
//
// TWO VEHICLES, one rule. When this process runs a Qt event loop the callback
// is queued onto it exactly as before, so it lands on the Qt thread and cannot
// race QObjects or UI code — unchanged behaviour for every Qt host. When this
// process has never had one, the callback goes to the dedicated delivery thread
// above instead of being dropped. Nothing in between: there is no path that
// runs it on the completing thread.
//
// WHY "HAS NEVER HAD ONE" AND NOT "DOES NOT HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW", which is the
// one subtlety in this function. instance() also goes null during
// ~QCoreApplication, so the naive test would start delivering on a foreign
// thread while the Qt app is being torn down — and module teardown after the
// application is gone is not exotic, it is what static-destruction ordering
// produces, with stopAndCancelCalls() handing every in-flight call a
// cancellation callback at exactly that moment. Running user code on a side
// thread into half-destroyed module state is a worse outcome than not running
// it, and it would be a NEW failure mode introduced into every Qt app by a
// bug-fix change. So the flag latches: a process that has ever been seen with
// an event loop keeps the old shutdown behaviour (the callback is dropped),
// and a process that has never had one gets the delivery thread. A Qt host
// therefore sees no behavioural difference at all — which is the point.
//
// THE RESIDUE, ENUMERATED, because "exactly once" was untrue here once already
// and a vague replacement is how that happens twice. Three shapes do NOT get a
// delivery, and all three are properties of the host process, not of the call:
//
//   1. A Qt process AFTER ~QCoreApplication. The callback is dropped, by the
//      decision above.
//   2. A process that constructs a QCoreApplication and never runs its event
//      loop. The delivery is queued onto a loop that never turns, so it never
//      runs. Nothing here can fix that: the callback's whole contract is that it
//      arrives on the Qt thread, and delivering it anywhere else would be the
//      thread-affinity violation this hop exists to prevent. Not new, not
//      introduced here — this is what "queue it onto the Qt loop" has always
//      meant — but it is a case where the header used to promise exactly once,
//      so it is named.
//   3. A process that had a QCoreApplication TRANSIENTLY — constructed and
//      destroyed while the process goes on to run Qt-free. The latch keeps
//      dropping for the rest of that process's life. It is the price of the
//      choice in (1): from inside postDelivery, "the app is gone because the
//      process is shutting down" and "the app is gone because a helper's app
//      object went out of scope" are the same observation, and getting (1) wrong
//      breaks every existing Qt host at exit while getting (3) wrong breaks a
//      shape no host in this codebase has. The trade is deliberate and is not
//      hidden: the guarantee below is worded as "a process with no
//      QCoreApplication in its life", not "a process without one right now".
//
// logos_object.h states all three where callers read the contract.
//
// Deliberately a FREE function taking everything BY VALUE, and deliberately not
// a member: the queued lambda runs later, which for a call cancelled by
// teardown is after the PlainLogosObject is already gone. Nothing it touches
// may belong to the object — which is why AsyncCall copies objectName/method up
// front instead of reading m_objectName from inside here. Do not give this a
// `this`.
//
// THE FOLD MADE THIS LOAD-BEARING TWICE OVER. It was already the reason a
// delivery could outlive the handle. It is now also the answer to the
// re-entrancy hazard: every one of the four places that can complete a call —
// the Asio read handler on the connection's strand, fail()'s sweep on an
// arbitrary thread, the deadline handler on the timer thread, and teardown on
// the caller's thread — routes its delivery through here, so NO user callback
// ever runs on an Asio handler stack. That is the class of bug that produced the
// deferred-multi SIGSEGV on the QtRO twin, whose fix (remote_transport.cpp) is
// the same move by a different vehicle: QTimer::singleShot(0).

// The old design gave every pending RPC an OS thread whose only job was to be
// blockable: std::future cannot be waited on with a deadline AND a cancel, so
// the waiter polled it in 25ms slices, then parked on a condition variable for
// the deferred half, then delivered. Three costs came with that — a thread per
// pending call, a 25ms floor on teardown, and a registry-plus-reaping protocol
// to stop finished threads accumulating (a thread cannot join itself).
//
// Here the call is a piece of STATE that three events race to finish:
//
//   * the reply, delivered by RpcConnection as a handler (its strand, or any
//     thread via fail(), or inline when the connection is already stopped);
//   * the deadline, an asio::steady_timer on the DeadlineService's own thread;
//   * cancellation, from teardown on an arbitrary thread.
//
// EXACTLY ONCE is the `claim()` CAS below, and nothing else. That is a real
// change of mechanism and the thing most worth distrusting: the old guarantee
// was structural (one thread, one function, four returns, and a join proving it
// had finished), whereas three independent callers can all arrive here. The CAS
// is what makes the first one win and the other two no-ops, on every path.
//
// LIFETIME is ownership, not a barrier. Each of those three holds a shared_ptr
// to this object; the state it needs on the HANDLE is reached through a weak_ptr
// to CallState, and the connection through a weak_ptr too. Nothing here

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This thread's nesting depth inside ANY PlainLogosObject entry point. Two
// readers, both of them detector-side: it subtracts the caller's own frames from
// the count reportConcurrentCallers reads, and it tells EntryGuard whether an
// entry is a FRESH one from outside or a nested internal one, which is what keeps
// the "entered after release" report off callMethodWithError ->
// ensureCompletionSub -> onEvent.
//
// THE SHAPE IT EXISTS TO IGNORE: a thread that is inside a public method and,
// from there, reaches teardown on the same object — a callback invoked from
// within a call, releasing the handle it was called through. That is a
// well-defined single-threaded sequence, not the race, and it is SAFE under the
// reference count (the outer call holds a reference, so release() cannot destroy
// the object underneath it and the guard does it on the way out). Reporting it
// would be a false alarm. No path in this file invokes user code from inside a
// guarded method today, so this is guarding a shape that does not yet exist —
// which is exactly when it is cheap to guard.
//
// It counts entries into ANY object rather than into a particular one, because
// a per-object thread-local is a map lookup on every call and the difference
// only matters for a thread that is inside object A while releasing object B.
// That case is not the defect, and the bias it introduces is the safe one:
// this can only ever make the detector MISS a real race, never invent one.
// Internal linkage: nothing outside this file may read it, and it must not
// become an exported thread-local in the shared build.
static thread_local int t_entryDepth = 0;

// THE REFERENCE IS THE FIRST AND THE LAST THING EITHER OF THESE TOUCHES, and
// that ordering is the whole safety argument.
//
// ON THE WAY IN the reference must be taken before any other access to the
// object, because everything after it is what the reference protects. On the way
// out it must be dropped after every other access, because dropping it may
// DESTROY the object — this guard is the thing that performs the final `delete`
// when it is the last one out, and any bookkeeping after that point would be a
// store into freed memory. The earlier, detector-only version of this guard
// learned that the hard way: it restored m_lastEntryPoint after decrementing,
// which opened a window exactly one store wide for a concurrent release() to
// `delete this` in, and that segfaulted a Linux CI run in an existing test whose
// io-thread event callback releases the handle (IoFoldTest
// .ReleaseFromInsideAnIoThreadEventCallbackDoesNotWedge).
//
// So: reference first, reference last, everything else in between.
//
// THE RESIDUAL INSTANT is the increment itself, and it is the boundary of what
// this mechanism can do. A caller whose increment lands after release() has
// already dropped the owner's reference and freed the storage is incrementing an
// integer inside a dead object; nothing can be read out of freed memory to
// prevent that, which is why entering after release() stays a caller error
// rather than becoming safe. A call that entered BEFORE release() was called has
// no such problem: its increment is ordered before release()'s decrement in the
// modification order of m_liveRefs, so release() sees it, declines to destroy
// and leaves the destruction to this guard.
//
// The cost of handing the diagnostic name back before the decrement is a
// slightly vaguer message: a concurrent reader can see the OUTER frame's name
// rather than the inner one. That is a diagnostic string; correctness of the
// count is what matters.

    // own events and drop our reference — the connection stays alive
    // until PlainTransportConnection itself is destroyed.
    //
    // stopAndCancelCalls() before delete, and it BLOCKS ON NOTHING. In-flight
    // calls used to be threads that captured `this`, so teardown had to ask them
    // to stop and then join them — a wait slice at best, the rest of the call's
    // timeout before that, and a use-after-free if they were merely detached.
    // Now they are shared-owned state that no longer refers to this object at
    // all, so cancelling is a flag, a sweep of the in-flight map, and one
    // callback per abandoned call.
    //
    // That also makes release() safe to call from inside an event callback
    // running on the single io thread — the reentrant shape remote_transport.cpp
    // documents — which a "post a no-op onto the strand and wait for it" barrier
    // could not have been: it would have deadlocked against itself.
    //
    // ── AND A CALL RUNNING ON ANOTHER THREAD RIGHT NOW ──────────────────────
    //
    // That used to be a use-after-free, and it is now safe. The defect was
    // reproduced deterministically on master and on both pending PRs: a
    // synchronous callMethod parked in its future wait, released from a second
    // thread, faults on the very next line it executes
    // (`m_conn->cancelPending(...)`), with and without Guard Malloc, because
    // release() ended in an unconditional `delete this`.
    //
    // WHAT MAKES IT SAFE. The object carries a live-reference count (m_liveRefs,
    // see EntryGuard above): 1 for the owner, plus one per caller currently
    // inside a public entry point. release() does the teardown and then drops
    // THE OWNER'S reference instead of deleting; whoever drops the count to zero
    // does the delete. With a call in flight that is the call's own thread, on
    // its way out, after its last access to the object.
    //
    // AND THE ARGUMENT THAT SAID THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE, because it is instructive
    // and it was wrong. It ran: any mechanism that could save the racing call has
    // to be reached THROUGH `this`, so the racing thread's first act would be to
    // read a freed object. True — for a call that ENTERS after destruction. It
    // conflates that with a call ALREADY INSIDE the object, which is the defect
    // actually reproduced: that call's reference was taken while the object was
    // provably alive (it is what its own thread did on the way in, before
    // release() was ever called), so its increment is ordered before release()'s
    // decrement in the modification order of m_liveRefs, and release() therefore
    // SEES it. Nothing is read through a dangling pointer anywhere in that
    // sequence. The counter is a member, and that is fine, because the thread
    // that has to trust the member is the thread that already published to it.
    //
    // WHAT IS STILL NOT SAFE, exactly:
    //
    //   * A CALL THAT ENTERS AT OR AFTER release(). Its very first act is to
    //     increment a counter that may already be freed. This is the shape the
    //     old argument describes correctly, it is what "the handle must not be
    //     used after release()" has always meant, and it stays a caller error.
    //     EntryGuard reports it (reportEntryAfterRelease) in the cases where the
    //     object is still alive to notice — i.e. when another call in flight is
    //     holding it — and in the cases where it is not, there is nothing left to
    //     look at.
    //   * `delete obj` INSTEAD OF release() with calls in flight. The caller has
    //     demanded the storage back now, so there is no destruction left to
    //     defer. The destructor reports it (reportConcurrentCallers) and aborts
    //     in debug builds.
    //   * TWO release()es ON THE SAME HANDLE. The second one is a call entering
    //     after destruction, by the definition above.
    //
    // THE COSTS, since deferring a destruction is not free:
    //
    //   * release() still returns immediately, and still waits for nothing — the
    //     property the two preceding changes exist to establish is untouched, and
    //     the reentrant release()-from-an-io-thread-event-callback shape still
    //     cannot deadlock, because nothing here blocks.
    //   * The OBJECT, and with it its share of the connection, now lives until
    //     the last call in flight leaves — bounded by that call's own timeout,
    //     which the caller chose. A handle released while a 30-second call is
    //     parked keeps ~200 bytes and one shared_ptr count alive for the rest of
    //     that call. stopAndCancelCalls() has already cancelled everything it can
    //     wake, so the only thing that can still take the full time is a
    //     synchronous call parked in the connection's future, which nothing in
    //     this transport can interrupt.
    //   * m_conn IS NOT RESET HERE any more, and that is a correctness
    //     requirement rather than a simplification: the parked caller's next act
    //     is `m_conn->cancelPending(...)`, and resetting a shared_ptr while
    //     another thread reads it is a data race on the shared_ptr itself. The
    //     member is released by the destructor, which now runs when nobody is
    //     inside the object.
