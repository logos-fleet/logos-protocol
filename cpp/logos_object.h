/**
 * @brief Abstract interface for a module object handle.
 *
 * LogosObject decouples callers from the underlying transport mechanism.
 * Each transport (local/Qt Remote Objects/mock/JSON-RPC/...) provides its
 * own concrete subclass.  Callers interact exclusively through this
 * interface and never need to know the implementation type.
 *
 * THREAD SAFETY, precisely — the two halves are not the same answer.
 *
 *   * CALLS are safe to make from several threads at once. The transports
 *     serialize what has to be serialized internally.
 *
 *   * release() IS NOT SAFE AGAINST A CONCURRENT CALL AT THIS LEVEL. release()
 *     destroys the object, so a call still executing on another thread is left
 *     dereferencing freed memory. Write callers as if that is always true: every
 *     call on a handle must have RETURNED before release() is entered. The
 *     common shape that trips it is a handle shared with a worker thread and
 *     released on teardown without waiting for the worker. Wait for it.
 *
 *     WHAT EACH TRANSPORT ACTUALLY DOES, because the answer is no longer uniform
 *     and the difference is not something a caller should rely on:
 *
 *       - PLAIN: safe. The object counts the callers inside it, release() drops
 *         the owner's reference rather than deleting, and the LAST call to leave
 *         destroys the object. A call that had entered before release() was
 *         called therefore runs to completion against a live object. release()
 *         itself still returns immediately and waits for nothing. Two shapes
 *         remain caller errors even there — STARTING a call at or after
 *         release() (its first act is to touch storage that may already be
 *         freed), and `delete obj` in place of release() with a call in flight —
 *         and both are reported, aborting in debug builds, whenever the object
 *         still exists to notice. See plain_logos_object.cpp.
 *       - QT REMOTE / QT LOCAL / MOCK: not safe. release() ends in `delete
 *         this`, with no counting and no detector.
 *
 *     So the INTERFACE contract is the strict one above. A transport may be
 *     kinder than the contract; code written against the contract is correct on
 *     all of them, and code written against the plain transport's behaviour
 *     breaks the day it is handed a QtRO handle.

    /**
     * @brief Invoke a method asynchronously; result is delivered via callback.
     *
     * Returns immediately. The callback is invoked AT MOST ONCE — never twice,
     * never synchronously inside this call, and never on a transport's IO
     * thread. It is invoked EXACTLY once whenever it has somewhere to run, and
     * the three cases where it does not are listed below rather than left to be
     * discovered: an unconditional promise here would be a promise the code
     * cannot keep.
     *
     * WHERE it runs, which is a property of the process and not of the call:
     * when the process has a Qt event loop the callback is queued onto it and
     * therefore lands on the Qt thread, which is what every Qt host sees. A
     * transport that supports Qt-free hosts (the plain transport) delivers on
     * its own dedicated delivery thread when the process has no QCoreApplication
     * at all, rather than dropping the callback — which is what it used to do,
     * making "exactly once" mean "never" in a Qt-free process. Callers that need
     * their own thread affinity must hop themselves; callers in a Qt host see no
     * change.
     *
     * WHERE IT IS NOT DELIVERED, exhaustively for the plain transport:
     *
     *   1. In a Qt process, after QCoreApplication has been destroyed. There is
     *      nowhere left to deliver it that is worth the cost — running user code
     *      on a side thread while the objects it closes over are being torn down
     *      is a worse outcome than silence.
     *   2. In a process that constructs a QCoreApplication and never RUNS its
     *      event loop. The delivery is queued onto that loop, and a loop that
     *      never turns never runs it. "Has a Qt event loop" means a loop that
     *      actually spins; a QCoreApplication that is only constructed is not
     *      one, and the callback waits forever.
     *   3. In a process that had a QCoreApplication TRANSIENTLY and is Qt-free
     *      afterwards: case 1's rule latches, so the rest of that process keeps
     *      dropping. From inside the transport, "the app is gone because we are
     *      shutting down" and "the app is gone because a helper's app object went
     *      out of scope" are indistinguishable, and guessing wrong in the other
     *      direction would start running user callbacks on a side thread during
     *      every Qt host's teardown.
     *
     * A process with NO QCoreApplication in its life is not on that list, and
     * that is deliberate: there the delivery holds for the whole life of the
     * process, INCLUDING static destruction after main() has returned (the plain
     * transport's delivery thread is never torn down, precisely so that a
     * callback issued from a static destructor still lands). The one thing that
     * can still cut it short is the process itself exiting before the delivery
     * thread runs — an ordinary race with process termination, not a decision
     * made here.

 *
 * This interface is DELIBERATELY a sibling of LogosObject rather than more
 * virtuals on it. LogosObject is an installed header (`include/logos_object.h`)
 * whose vtable is baked into every statically-linked copy of liblogos_protocol
 * in a process — one per loaded module, each pinned to its own protocol

 * came from an older copy is undefined behaviour. Declaring a separate
 * interface and reaching it with dynamic_cast leaves LogosObject's layout,
 * size and vtable byte-for-byte unchanged, so no such pairing can exist:
 * a copy that does not know about this interface simply fails the cast.

 * transports. NOT implemented by the mock transport: MockStore always answers,

 * one subclass whose header is installed (implementations/mock/mock_transport.h)

/**
 * @brief Optional extension: a call made ON BEHALF OF a named caller.
 *
 * A RELAY IS NOT IDENTIFIABLE BY ITS TOKEN, and that is the whole reason this
 * exists. The Web container publishes a page as an ordinary provider and
 * forwards every inbound dispatch to it over the web transport, presenting THAT
 * MODULE'S OWN root credential — the only credential it has. A page therefore
 * derives "who is calling me" from a token that says nothing about the caller,
 * and the honest-looking derivation (the name the token was filed under)
 * answers the page ITS OWN NAME for every caller in the fleet. Measured on a
 * device: `keystore_module.caller_identity()`, asked by `wallet_ui`, answered
 * `module "keystore_module"` (logos-workspace#129).
 *
 * So the identity travels as DATA, beside the token rather than inside it:
 * `callerJson` is the logos-protocol caller document (logos_module_impl.h has
 * the normative shape) of the dispatch the relay is forwarding, and it lands in
 * CallMessage::caller.
 *
 * WHO MAY USE IT: a relay that is inside a dispatch and is forwarding THAT
 * dispatch. Not an ordinary consumer making its own outbound call — there the
 * caller is the consumer itself, and passing on whoever called IT would be a
 * confused deputy. Which is exactly why this is an explicit argument rather
 * than something the transport picks up from an ambient thread-local: the two
 * cases are indistinguishable from inside the transport and only the call site
 * knows which one it is.
 *
 * A SIBLING INTERFACE, NOT A VIRTUAL ON LogosObject, for the reason spelled out
 * on LogosObjectErrorChannel above: LogosObject's vtable is baked into every
 * statically-linked copy of liblogos_protocol in the process, so appending a
 * slot is undefined behaviour across a version boundary. Consumers MUST treat
 * it as optional:
 *
 *     if (auto* c = dynamic_cast<LogosObjectCallerChannel*>(obj))
 *         c->callMethodForCaller(caller, tok, m, a, ms);
 *     else
 *         obj->callMethod(tok, m, a, ms);   // today's behaviour, unchanged
 *
 * Implemented by the plain transport's handle (PlainLogosObject), which is what
 * the tcp, tcp_ssl AND web transports all hand back. Not implemented by the
 * QtRO, qt_local or mock handles: a native module reached over those already
 * gets its caller pushed across the module-impl C ABI by the generated glue,
 * which is the mechanism this one stands in for where there is no such glue.
