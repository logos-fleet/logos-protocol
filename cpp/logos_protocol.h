#ifndef LOGOS_PROTOCOL_H
#define LOGOS_PROTOCOL_H

/* ===========================================================================
 * logos_protocol.h — the public, language-neutral C ABI of logos-protocol.
 *
 * This is the ONE seam every Logos SDK builds on. The data model is
 * JSON-in-strings: method arguments are a JSON array, results are a JSON
 * value, event payloads are a JSON array — all UTF-8 `const char*`.
 *
 * Ownership:
 *   - Every `char*` RETURNED by this library is heap-allocated and owned by
 *     the caller; free it with lp_string_free() (safe on NULL).
 *   - Every `const char*` PASSED IN is borrowed for the duration of the call.
 *
 * Bytes encoding: binary data crossing this ABI is encoded inside JSON as
 *   {"_bytes": "<base64url>"}
 * (a single-key object). This is lossless for arbitrary bytes, including
 * embedded NUL. It matches the plain-wire encoding (json_mapping.cpp) and is
 * the canonical representation at this boundary.
 *
 * Error shape: structural failures report one canonical JSON object through
 * `out_error_json` / error callbacks:
 *   {"code": "<machine_code>", "message": "<human text>", "origin": "<module>"}
 *
 * Threading / event-loop contract:
 *   - Callbacks may arrive on an internal protocol thread — never assume
 *     they run on your own thread.
 *   - Handles are thread-safe per-handle: calls on one handle may be made
 *     from any thread; the library marshals to the handle's owner thread
 *     internally where required.
 *   - Qt-free transports (plain tcp/tcp_ssl, web, mock) are serviced by the
 *     library's own workers or by the message channel they were handed — no
 *     caller event loop is needed.
 *   - The Qt Remote Objects transport (the current default inside module
 *     processes) ADDITIONALLY requires a running Qt event loop in the
 *     process. Every Logos module process has one (logos_host runs it).
 *     Standalone non-Qt consumers must use the plain transport.
 *     A client on that transport is created on — and owned by — the Qt main
 *     thread no matter which thread calls lp_client_create(), because its
 *     node and socket are only serviced by that thread's loop. Calls from
 *     other threads marshal onto it and block until it answers.
 *   - lp_invoke() blocks the calling thread until the result arrives or the
 *     timeout elapses (timeout_ms <= 0 selects the default, currently 20s).
 *
 * Cancellation / lifetime:
 *   - After lp_client_destroy() / lp_unsubscribe() RETURNS, no further
 *     callbacks fire for that handle; pending async results are dropped.
 *     `user_data` may be freed only after that point, never before.
 *   - Both are safe to call from ANY thread, including a worker that happens
 *     to drop the last reference to a client. lp_client_destroy() defers the
 *     underlying teardown to the client's owner thread when called elsewhere,
 *     so the handle may outlive the call by an event-loop turn — the
 *     no-callbacks guarantee above holds regardless.
 *
 * Versioning: this library carries the logos-protocol semantic version —
 * the single number that governs Logos load/call compatibility. Two
 * participants interoperate iff they share the same MAJOR. MINOR is
 * additive/back-compatible; PATCH never affects compatibility.
 * =========================================================================== */

// HOW TO GUARD A CONDITIONAL SURFACE, and it is not what it looks like.
//
// Every entry below is additive at a MINOR, so codegen guards the surface on
// the version it appeared at. The obvious spelling is wrong:
//
//     #if LOGOS_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MINOR >= 5          // WRONG
//
// because at 1.0.0 the MINOR resets to 0 and every such guard silently goes
// false. Nothing fails to build and nothing fails to load — the definitions and
// the calls disappear together — so the symptom is modules quietly losing
// teardown and grantability, with no diagnostic anywhere. Compare the pair:
//
//     #if defined(LOGOS_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MINOR) &&     // RIGHT
//         (LOGOS_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MAJOR > 0 ||
//          (LOGOS_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MAJOR == 0 &&
//           LOGOS_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MINOR >= 5))
//
// Emit the arithmetic expanded rather than behind a function-like macro: the
// generated sources are resolved by `unifdef` in the backends' ABI checks, and
// unifdef handles nested integer arithmetic but silently no-ops on what it
// cannot evaluate. logos-rust-sdk already gets this right by comparing the
// tuple (major, minor).
#define LOGOS_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MAJOR 0
// 0.10: a fourth transport — `{"protocol":"web"}` (LogosProtocol::Web), the
// plain transport's message set (Call, Result, Subscribe, Unsubscribe, Event,
// Token, Methods, MethodsResult) carried as JSON over an injected message
// channel with no byte framing, for a module living inside a webview (ADR
// 0005). ModuleProxy sees it as transport tag "web", alongside "local", "tcp"
// and "tcp_ssl".
//
// ADDITIVE, and at the ABI level there is nothing new to be additive ABOUT:
// this MINOR adds no lp_* function and no module-impl export. It is a new VALUE
// in an existing enum plus a new spelling accepted by lp_set_default_transport
// / lp_client_create's transport JSON, so every pre-0.10 caller compiles,
// links and loads unchanged, and a pre-0.10 image simply never asks for "web"
// (its parser falls back to "local", which is the behaviour it already had for
// any unknown protocol string).
//
// WHY A MINOR RATHER THAN A PATCH, since no symbol moved: a participant that
// does not have this cut cannot TALK to a Web module at all — the tag it would
// have to authorize against does not exist in its ModuleProxy, and the
// transport it would have to resolve does not exist in its factory. That is a
// capability difference between two same-MAJOR participants, which is exactly
// what MINOR is for, and it is what a host checks before offering to run one.
//
// 0.6: the caller of a dispatch — logos_module_set_call_caller()
// (logos_module_impl.h), which carries WHO is calling into the module image for
// the duration of one dispatch, plus the host half that produces the document
// (logos::CallerScope / logos::currentInboundCallerJson, logos_caller_scope.h,
// resolved by ModuleProxy::authorize as a by-product of the authorization scan
// it was already performing).
//
// Additive at the ABI level and at the INTERFACE level, which are two separate
// claims and both matter here. At the ABI: a cdylib generated below 0.6 exports
// no such symbol and the glue generated alongside it emits no call. At the
// interface: the caller is NOT a declared parameter and never appears in a
// .lidl — it is an ambient accessor — so no module's signature changes, nothing
// opts in per method, and a module that never asks is unaffected.
//
// WHY A MINOR AND NOT A PATCH, since the surface is only reachable through a
// generated call: a new REQUIRED module-impl export is exactly the thing the
// two prior ABI breaks were. Both (grant_host_services at 0.3, the teardown
// pair at 0.5) shipped with caller and module in perfect agreement about the
// version and still failed at dlopen on Linux only, because version agreement
// says nothing about which SYMBOLS a backend's emitter writes. The MINOR is
// what the guards are keyed to — the generator guard that emits the call, the
// backend guard that emits the definition, and the exports.txt every backend
// diffs itself against — so a surface with no MINOR of its own has no way to be
// guarded and no way to be checked.
// 0.5: the module teardown pair — logos_module_about_to_unload() and
// logos_module_set_unload_done_callback() (logos_module_impl.h), which let a
// module finish work before it is torn down. Additive at the ABI level: a
// cdylib generated below 0.5 exports neither, and the glue generated alongside
// it emits no calls, so an older module keeps the teardown it always had.
//
// An earlier version of this note went further and called that arrangement
// safe. It is not, and the ABI has been broken twice on the strength of it —
// grant_host_services at 0.3 and this pair at 0.5. Being generated in the same
// build makes the glue and the module agree on the VERSION; it says nothing
// about which SYMBOLS a given language backend's emitter writes for that
// version, because each backend implements this ABI independently. Both
// breakages happened at perfect version agreement, and both were invisible on
// macOS and fatal on Linux. See the note above logos_module_about_to_unload in
// logos_module_impl.h, and nix/module-impl-abi.nix, which publishes this
// header's export list so every backend can check itself against it.
// 0.4: per-identity token stores — lp_token_isolate_identity() and the four
// functions around it (lp_token_identity_is_isolated, lp_token_get_for,
// lp_token_save_for, lp_token_reset_identity), plus lp_client_create resolving
// its store through the origin instead of the image singleton. Additive: with
// nothing isolated, forIdentity() returns the same object instance() does, so
// every pre-0.4 host and binding runs on exactly the store it ran on before —
// the new symbols are the only way to get any other behaviour.
// 0.3: the trust-root surface — lp_grant_host_services() plus the two functions
// it gates (lp_token_keys, lp_inform_module_token_to), and the module-impl
// export that carries the grant across the cdylib boundary
// (logos_module_grant_host_services, logos_module_impl.h). Additive: no
// existing symbol changes behaviour, and an image that is never granted sees
// exactly the pre-0.3 surface — the gates are closed by default — so a host
// that knows nothing about the grant keeps working unmodified.
// 0.2: per-module concurrent dispatch ("multi"). Additive/back-compatible — a
// multi module returns a deferred-completion sentinel from callMethod and pushes
// the result as a __logos_call_complete__ event (see logos_async_dispatch.h);
// the provider/host ABI is UNCHANGED, so same-MAJOR hosts (incl. 0.1 daemons)
// load and forward multi modules without modification. A pre-0.2 *consumer*
// would see the raw sentinel rather than awaiting it — graceful, not a crash.
// 0.7: an isolated identity's OWN credential — lp_token_adopt_credential(),
// and the behaviour change that makes it necessary: a private token store is
// created EMPTY instead of inheriting this image's "core"/"capability_module"
// tokens. That inheritance handed every isolated identity the HOST's credential,
// which authorized as the host at any callee (the caller document came back
// {"kind":"host"}) and satisfied ModuleProxy::informModuleToken's
// trusted-channel gate — a write into another module's token map, reachable
// with three public calls and no generated glue.
//
// ADDITIVE AT THE ABI, BREAKING FOR ISOLATED IDENTITIES, and the two halves have
// to be said separately. No symbol changes signature, no module-impl export is
// added, and a host that never calls lp_token_isolate_identity /
// TokenManager::isolateIdentity is bit-for-bit unaffected: forIdentity() still
// returns instance() pointer-identically for every un-isolated name. A host that
// DOES isolate and does not adopt is broken loudly and immediately — its first
// outbound call dies at ModuleProxy::authorize's empty-token check with
// "auth token not recognized" — which is the intended failure mode for a change
// that removes a credential nobody was entitled to. Ship protocol, then
// logos-plugin-qt, then the hosts, with matching flake.locks.
// 0.8: the INBOUND door -- lp_token_save_inbound(), and the module-impl export
// that carries it across the cdylib boundary
// (logos_module_accept_inbound_token, logos_module_impl.h).
//
// WHAT IT CLOSES. The generated Qt glue's informModuleToken wrote the SAME value
// through two doors: LogosProviderBase::informModuleToken (inbound, into the
// HOST image's store) and logos_module_accept_token (which forwarded to
// lp_token_save -- OUTBOUND, into the cdylib's own store). The value is a
// CALLER's token, so the second write filed it as a credential this module would
// PRESENT to that caller. Measured end to end on shipped artifacts: after
// capability_module minted <A -> B> and pushed it to B, B's own client found it
// under "A", skipped requestModule, presented it to A, was rejected, and
// re-exchanged. Every such pair paid a rejection plus a full extra round trip,
// forever, and the caller saw only success.
//
// ADDITIVE AT THE ABI, and unusually cleanly so: no existing symbol changes
// signature or behaviour, logos_module_accept_token keeps meaning exactly what
// its name says, and a module generated below 0.8 emits neither the call nor
// the definition and behaves exactly as it does today.
//
// NOT ADDITIVE FOR A TOKEN REGISTRY, which is the one thing to get right when
// reading this. See lp_token_save_inbound below.
//
// AND WHAT DID **NOT** HAPPEN AT 0.7, said here because it nearly cost the
// fleet. The inbound/outbound split shipped under 0.7 without a version of its
// own AND with three members where TokenManager had one, which moved m_mutex
// from +24 to +56 on an object the host allocates and module images mutate.
// Two versions of that object both answered "0.7.0" and mixing them deadlocked
// a host process on the first token push, with no diagnostic anywhere. The
// storage is now a key namespace inside the original single QHash, so the
// layout is back to what every shipped module was compiled against and MAJOR
// remains the only gate that has to mean anything. token_manager.h's private
// section carries the measurements; token_manager.cpp's static_assert is the
// tripwire.
// 0.9: subscription continuity -- a per-TARGET status callback, generation
// counter and restart policy (lp_client_set_subscription_status_cb,
// lp_client_subscription_generation, lp_client_set_subscription_options,
// lp_client_rearm_subscriptions), plus the liveness watchdog that makes them
// mean something (LogosPendingSubscriptions::checkLiveness).
//
// WHAT IT CLOSES. A provider that unloads and reloads drives its replica out of
// Valid and back on the SAME node, and the event helper stays attached to that
// replica -- so the subscription survives, and NOTHING said so. Events emitted
// while it was down reached nobody, the stream resumed, and no subscriber could
// tell that hole from a module that had gone quiet. Nothing was even LOOKING:
// reconnected() covers a torn-down connection and reviveArmed() a replaced
// handle, but neither watches a provider die under an already-armed
// subscription, and the retry timer stopped once everything armed. Detection is
// the substance of this MINOR; the callback is the cheap half.
//
// WHY THE RE-ARM STAYS, rather than "a re-established subscription is a new one,
// so stop re-arming". It is load-bearing: a module subscribing during init(),
// and a ui_qml backend during onContextReady(), both run before the dependency
// calls listen(), and the deferred arm is what makes those work at all.
// Removing it would hand every consumer that has not adopted the callback
// SILENT EVENT LOSS -- strictly worse than the silent resume. So the re-arm
// stays and becomes observable, and {"restart":"manual"} is there for a
// consumer that would rather be told the stream ended than handed a
// continuation of it (LP_SUB_HELD instead of LP_SUB_LOST, never both).
//
// EVERYTHING IS KEYED BY TARGET MODULE. m_handles holds ONE handle per object
// name and every subscription to it attaches there, so a provider that dies
// takes all of them down together; there is no state in which two subscriptions
// to one module disagree. Keying per subscription reported one event N times
// and admitted a combination that cannot occur -- an automatic and a manual
// subscription to the SAME module diverging permanently on the first loss. Two
// tests in test_subscription_restart_policy.cpp pin the coupling.
//
// 0.9 WAS REVISED IN PLACE, which matters because this header promises MINORs
// are additive. An earlier 0.9 landed on master with the same feature keyed per
// subscription (lp_subscribe_ex, lp_subscription_generation); those symbols are
// GONE. That is a removal from a MINOR, allowed exactly once, here, because 0.9
// had not left the tree -- every consumer was in this repo, the three SDKs and
// the json-rpc bridge, all moving in the same wave. A later MINOR does not get
// this latitude.
//
// AND THE PRICE, which is worth knowing before you debug it: BOTH cuts report
// LOGOS_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MINOR 9, so a VERSION guard cannot tell them apart. A
// consumer still pinned to the first cut (48afc01) sees the removal as a
// MISSING SYMBOL -- a compile error in C++, and a dlopen-time undefined symbol
// in Rust, whose extern "C" declarations are unconditional and so link against
// nothing until load.
//
// LOGOS_PROTOCOL_HAS_CLIENT_SUBSCRIPTION_STATE exists for exactly this: a C++
// consumer that must build against both cuts cannot use `MINOR >= 9`, which
// compiles the new call sites against a protocol that does not export them.
// Not hypothetical -- logos-cpp-sdk shipped that guard, and its doctests, which
// build downstream modules from those modules' OWN older locks, caught it.
//
// NOTE FOR ANYONE ADOPTING IT: this macro POSTDATES the revision, so a consumer
// that must also work against the merged 47d287c has to accept LP_SUB_HELD as
// well -- that code arrived WITH the client-scoped surface and is absent from
// every protocol without it. logos-cpp-sdk spells the condition
// `defined(LOGOS_PROTOCOL_HAS_CLIENT_SUBSCRIPTION_STATE) || defined(LP_SUB_HELD)`
// for that reason. Guarding on this macro ALONE against 47d287c compiles the
// feature out silently, which is worse than the build break it replaces.
//
// Rust gets no preprocessor and so cannot guard at all; its only defence is
// closure discipline, one protocol per closure via `follows`.
//
// ADDITIVE OTHERWISE: lp_subscribe is retained VERBATIM and everything new is a
// separate function on lp_client. That spelling is not cosmetic -- logos-rust-sdk
// hand-declares lp_subscribe in an `extern "C"` block, and Rust does not check
// it against the real symbol, so an arity change would link against the same
// name and mis-call it with no diagnostic. The generation counter is maintained
// for EVERY client, so gap detection reaches a consumer that changes nothing;
// only the live callback is opt-in.
#define LOGOS_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MINOR 10
#define LOGOS_PROTOCOL_VERSION_PATCH 0
#define LOGOS_PROTOCOL_VERSION_STRING "0.10.0"

// FEATURE MACRO, because the version macros cannot answer this one. Both 0.9
// cuts report MINOR 9, so `MINOR >= 9` is true of a protocol that has these
// four symbols and of one that does not. Guard on this instead:
//
//     #if defined(LOGOS_PROTOCOL_HAS_CLIENT_SUBSCRIPTION_STATE)
//
// Absent below the revision, including on the first cut of 0.9. Defined and
// never undefined from here on, so a later MINOR keeps satisfying it.

 * These lp_* functions are the stable C ABI the JS and Rust SDKs bind to, so

 * is a statement about PARITY and not about completeness. Reported: failure to

 * a rejected auth token, and MODULE_NOT_LOADED from a host that is up. Both
 * twins report all four; neither did before.
 *
 * NOT reported, and it is not an oversight: an unknown method name. Every
 * provider flavour answers one with a bare null, byte-identical to a method
 * that legitimately returns null, so the distinction does not exist on the
 * wire to be reported. Closing it needs a provider-contract change across the
 * SDKs, not a transport change here. A provider's own rejection of well-formed
 * arguments ("dispatch_failed") is likewise NOT folded in by either twin — it
 * arrives as a result, and the generated wrappers fold it.
 *
 * Argument/handle validation still fails synchronously with

 * Tokens
 *
 * THE WHOLE lp_token_* FAMILY IS THE **OUTBOUND** FAMILY, and this paragraph is
 * the contract, not a description of today's callers. `module_name` everywhere
 * below is the module being CALLED, and the value is the token this image will
 * PRESENT to it. None of these writes authorizes anybody to call US.
 *
 * ONE FUNCTION HERE IS NOT OUTBOUND, and it is the last one in the section:
 * lp_token_save_inbound, added at 0.8. Everything named above it is outbound;
 * it is placed after the family and labelled at every mention so the paragraph
 * above stays readable as the rule it is.
 *
 * WHY AN INBOUND DOOR EXISTS AT ALL, since an earlier version of this note
 * argued one was UNREPRESENTABLE and that the absence was a stronger guarantee
 * than a doc comment on a door that exists. The argument was that a cdylib has
 * no LogosAPI, no ModuleProxy and never authorizes, so every read of its store
 * is an outbound presentation. Both halves are true and neither is the point:
 * the problem was never a cdylib READING inbound, it was the generated glue
 * WRITING a caller's token through the only door available, which was the
 * outbound one. With one door the direction had nowhere to go, so an inbound
 * grant landed in the outbound cache and the module then presented a peer's own
 * token back at that peer. Measured end to end on shipped artifacts: after
 * capability_module minted <A -> B> and pushed it to B, B's client found the
 * value under "A", skipped requestModule, presented it to A, was rejected, and
 * re-exchanged -- a rejection plus a full extra round trip on every call of
 * every two-way pair, permanently, reported to the caller as success. A second
 * door is what gives the inbound value somewhere to land that no outbound read
 * can reach.
 *
 * `logos_module_accept_token` (logos_module_impl.h) is therefore the OUTBOUND
 * door and nothing else -- the module's own anchor, seeded in the glue's
 * onInit. The caller path goes through logos_module_accept_inbound_token.
 * Both backends owe the new definition in the same wave as the declaration:
 * miss one and it links clean and dies at dlopen with an undefined symbol, on
 * Linux only, invisible on macOS. logos_module_impl.h records that this has
 * shipped twice at perfect version agreement. Note also that the
 * module-impl-abi checks in both SDKs only go red AFTER each bumps its
 * logos-protocol lock: declaring alone turns nothing red, and that lag is the
 * real risk.

 *  token, and refuses a name carrying the reserved namespace character --
 *  `caller` arrives over RPC, named by capability_module, so it must not be able
 *  to address any key but its own.
 *
 *  THE TOKEN-REGISTRY CARVE-OUT, and it is the whole reason this is not simply
 *  "the inbound half of lp_token_save". The same wire message means opposite
 *  things depending on WHO RECEIVES IT. To an ordinary provider,
 *  informModuleToken(caller, token) is "caller may present this to you" --
 *  inbound. To the module holding the token registry it is "here is module X's
 *  token; present it when you call X" -- outbound, and the same map is also the

 *  exactly that: lp_token_keys() for the known-caller gate, lp_token_get() for
 *  the credential it presents when pushing to the target.
 *
 *  So when, and only when, this image holds the "token_registry" grant, this
 *  ALSO writes the outbound half. Without the carve-out, routing the glue's
 *  second write here empties capability_module's roster and every cross-module
 *  call in the fleet is refused with "rejecting request from unknown module
 *  identity" -- fail-closed, but a fleet-wide lockout at the first call.
 *
 *  The grant is the right discriminator rather than a codegen flag: it IS the
 *  declaration of the registry role (metadata.json host_services), it is off by
 *  default and fail-closed, it is already what gates lp_token_keys, and it lives
 *  in the image whose store is being written. A per-module codegen flag would
