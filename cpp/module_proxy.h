 * INSTRUMENTATION, not a knob and not a diagnostic anyone should act on. It
 * exists so a test can assert the one timing property that is deterministic
 * enough to be worth asserting: the number of comparisons ModuleProxy performs
 * for an inbound call is a function of the STORE SIZES only — never of where
 * the matching token sits, nor of whether there was a match at all. An
 * accidental `break` or early `return` in either scan loop is exactly what that
 * catches, and is exactly what the constant-time compare exists to prevent.
 *
 * It asserts nothing about wall-clock time and no test here should claim it
 * does; see the note in tests/protocol/test_inbound_token_store.cpp.
 *
 * Always on rather than behind a build flag: a relaxed atomic increment is
 * unmeasurable next to the two heap allocations QString::toUtf8() already makes
 * on every one of these comparisons, and a check that only exists in a test
 * build is a check that stops matching the shipped code.

// token back to that same module. The module's BUSINESS object is published
// only after the initializer returns (so a caller keeps waiting at acquire
// until the module is genuinely ready, which is the long-standing contract).
// That left the push unsatisfiable: capability waited for a source that could
// not appear until the initializer returned, and the initializer could not
// return until capability answered.
//
// The handshake object is published BEFORE the initializer runs and carries
// token delivery only. capability can therefore always reach a module, while
// callers of real methods still block at acquire exactly as they always have.
