// The io_context fold: an async call is state plus a deadline, not a thread.
// This file is the evidence for that, and the replacement for
// test_plain_waiter_publish_is_last.cpp, whose subject (a waiter thread's
// publish ordering) no longer exists.
//
// WHAT IS PINNED HERE, and why each one needs its own test:
//
//   1. NO THREAD PER PENDING RPC — the point of the exercise. Measured with the
//      OS thread count of the PROCESS, against calls genuinely parked in a
//      provider that will not answer. Pre-fold this is +1 per in-flight call.
//
//   2. EXACTLY ONCE, on every path, counted PER CALL. This is the guarantee most
//      at risk from the rework, because its mechanism changed: it used to be
//      structural (one thread, one function body, and a join proving it had
//      finished) and is now a single CAS that three independent callers race for
//      — the reply handler, the deadline, and teardown. The plain outcomes
//      (normal / deferred / timeout / cancelled) are WEAK detectors of that: a
//      call resolved once calls deliver() once, and stays green with the CAS
//      removed. Measured, not assumed — so the strong one is a separate test
//      that puts teardown and a stream of arriving replies on the same calls.
//
//   3. THE DEADLINE IS NOT HOSTAGE TO THE IO THREAD. The version of this work
//      that put the per-call timer on the connection's strand had exactly one
//      regression, and this was it: IoContextPool runs ONE thread for the whole
//      process and this transport delivers user onEvent callbacks INLINE on it,
//      so an event handler that made a 2000ms call delayed a 200ms deadline on a
//      DIFFERENT connection to 2003ms. Both shapes are pinned — a busy io thread
//      and a permanently blocked one.
//
//   4. RETENTION IS BOUNDED BY WHAT IS IN FLIGHT, on both sides: the handle's
//      CallState registries AND the connection's pending-call map, which nothing
//      used to erase for a call resolved by its deadline.
//
//   5. NO USE-AFTER-FREE, which is what replaced the join. Nothing waits for the
//      io thread; instead no handler can reach the handle.
//
// HOW THE DETECTORS ARE VALIDATED. By running them against a transport that
// does not have the mechanism, in a throwaway checkout — two edits, neither of
// which is carried in this tree:
//
//   (a) AsyncCall::claim() stores `delivered` and returns true unconditionally
//       instead of compare-exchanging it, and takeCallback() returns a COPY of
//       the callback instead of swapping it out. Both halves have to go: they
//       are independently sufficient.
//   (b) deadlineContext() returns IoContextPool::shared().ioContext() — the
//       connections' own thread — instead of DeadlineService::shared()
//       .context(). That is the rejected design named in the DeadlineService
//       comment, so this measures the regression that class exists to prevent.
//
// A build option that did this from inside the shipped source was tried and
// removed: it left a second, knowingly wrong implementation of the exactly-once
// gate in the production translation unit, which is not a thing a correctness
// change gets to ship. (An earlier draft used getenv() probes and was worse in
// the same way.) Doing it as a local edit costs one throwaway build and proves
// the same thing. The related sub-order detector needs no edit at all — it goes
// red on pristine master; see test_plain_completion_sub_order.cpp.
//
// The numbers those runs produced, on an aarch64-darwin box:
//
//   ReleaseRacingRepliesInFlightDeliversEachCallOnce  (a)  6-16 double
//                                                          deliveries per
//                                                          10,000 calls, 4 runs
//   DeadlineFiresOnTimeWhileTheIoThreadIsBusy         (b)  200ms deadline fires
//                                                          at 2002ms
//   DeadlineFiresWhileTheIoThreadIsBlockedForever     (b)  never fires at all
//
// A green run of any of those against the stripped transport means the test is
// not exercising what it claims to, and is a bug in the test. Two candidates
// were REJECTED as exactly-once detectors on exactly that ground — see the
// comment on ReleaseRacingRepliesInFlightDeliversEachCallOnce.
//
// Everything runs against a live in-process PlainTransportHost over real TCP.

// ── the provider's own worker threads, and why they are counted ──────────────
//
// A "multi" provider answers with a pending sentinel and completes the call
// LATER, from a worker of its own — that is the whole point of `defer` below,
// and it is what makes the completion arrive on the consumer's io thread instead
// of inline in the reply. The worker calls the EventCallback ModuleProxy handed
// the provider in setEventListener(), and that listener captures `this` RAW
// (module_proxy.cpp): its first act is
// QMetaObject::invokeMethod(this, …, Qt::QueuedConnection), which dereferences
// the QObject.
//
// This fixture DELETES that proxy. The worker was spawned detached, so nothing
// proved it had finished, and `delete m_proxy` followed the last spawn by a
// couple of milliseconds — the fixture drains the CALLER's side of each round
// (pumpUntilTotal) but a release()d call is answered by teardown, so the round
// can be over before the provider has even run, leaving a backlog of `defer`
// calls that the proxy's thread is still working through while ~LiveHost runs.
//
// Reproduced on Linux (aarch64, Qt 6.9.2, gcc 14.3), `nix build .#tests`
// artifact, `--gtest_filter=IoFoldTest.*`, five concurrent copies — 6 of 50 runs
// on the tree this provider arrived on, 10 of 50 once the fixtures started
// destroying their host on the proxy's thread (which lets the backlog RUN instead
// of discarding it with QThread::quit(), so it widens this window rather than
// opening it). Every one of them with two to five worker threads standing in the
// same frame:
//
//     Thread "QThread" received signal SIGSEGV
//     QObject::thread() const
//     QMetaObject::invokeMethodImpl(QObject*, …)
//     ModuleProxy::ModuleProxy(...)::<lambda(const QString&, const QVariantList&)>
//                                                          module_proxy.cpp:37
//     std::function<void(const QString&, const QList<QVariant>&)>::operator()
//     OmniProvider::callMethod(...)::<lambda()>              this file, in defer
//     std::thread::_State_impl<…>::_M_run()
//
// The corpse is left by the test that spawned the worker and lands in whichever
// test runs NEXT, so it only appears in the WHOLE-BINARY run — the CI step that
// runs ./result/bin/protocol_tests. Under ctest every test is its own process, so
// the worker dies with the process that owned the proxy and there is nothing left
// to fault; `nix build .#tests` is green on the same tree, which is exactly how
// this hid.
//
// A COUNT, NOT A JOIN, deliberately. Making the workers joinable would hold their
// 8MB stacks until something reaped them — 400 outstanding in
// NormalAndDeferredCompletionsDeliverExactlyOnceAtVolume — and reaping from the
// dispatch thread would block the very thread `defer` exists to free. So they
// stay detached and the provider counts them; ~LiveHost waits for the count to
// reach zero at the one point where it is final.
//
// The same shape exists in test_plain_completion_sub_order.cpp
// (InstantMultiModule) and test_concurrent_dispatch.cpp, which additionally read
// the callback member through a captured `this`. Neither has been observed to
// fault and neither is touched here.

// because a detector that "usually" fires is not one.
//
//   * timeout-then-answer (2b above) is not a race at all any more: the delivery
//     withdraws the registration, so a reply arriving a comfortable interval
//     later never reaches the call.
//   * release-against-one-completion (further down) needs teardown to snapshot
//     the call in the few instructions between the completion handler taking it
//     out of `deferred` and deliver() taking it out of `inflight`. With the gate
//     removed it caught nothing in 6 solo runs of 300 rounds each, and caught
//     one double in a seventh run inside the full suite. It is a fine
//     use-after-free hammer and an unreliable exactly-once detector; a test that
//     fails one run in seven on broken code is not a gate.
//
// This one is wide by construction. Teardown snapshots the whole in-flight map
// under the lock and then delivers the calls ONE AT A TIME with the lock
// released, so with N calls outstanding the window in which the io thread can
// deliver a reply for a call teardown has already claimed is N deliveries long
// — not a handful of instructions. Both paths then arrive at deliver() for the
// same AsyncCall, and the CAS is the only thing deciding.
//
// Against a transport with the gate removed (edit (a) at the top of this file)
// this must report double deliveries. If it does not, the exactly-once

    // WHY THE TRIGGER IS A DIFFERENT HANDLE. This test used to issue the `fire`
    // call on `obj` itself, which meant the io thread could run obj->release()
    // while the main thread was still inside obj's own
    // callMethodAsyncWithError — a call racing its own handle's destruction,
    // which is undefined behaviour regardless of what this test is about.
    //
    // Be exact about the history, because it is easy to overclaim. The
    // violation was always there and was always UB; it was also always SILENT,
    // because the pre-existing code touches no member after sendCallAsync()
    // returns, so losing the race cost nothing observable. That stopped being
    // true the moment the release()-teardown bookkeeping was added to the
    // epilogue of every entry point, and the next Linux CI run segfaulted here.
    // Three things came out of that, and all three are fixed: the guard now
    // touches the object only between raising and dropping its reference (see
    // EntryGuard in plain_logos_object.cpp), that reference is what now makes
    // release()-racing-a-call safe rather than merely detected, and this test
    // stops relying on either — it no longer violates the contract at all.
    //
    // Firing through a second handle removes that unrelated violation and
    // changes nothing about the subject: the event still arrives on the io
    // thread, the handler still releases the handle it was delivered through,
    // and that handle still has an outstanding call for teardown to cancel.

    // A call left outstanding, so the reentrant release has real work to do:
    // it must cancel this and deliver its callback.
