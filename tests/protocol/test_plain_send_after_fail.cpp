// A CALL REGISTERED AS THE CONNECTION FAILS — the one send that was never
// answered at all.
//
// sendCallAsync() reads m_stopped and THEN registers its handler under m_mu.
// fail() flips m_stopped and THEN sweeps the pending map under the same mutex.
// Those two orders are opposed, so there is an interleaving in which nobody
// answers the call:
//
//     caller                              fail()
//     ------------------------------      -------------------------------
//     m_stopped.load()  -> false
//                                         CAS m_stopped -> true
//                                         lock(m_mu); swap(m_pendingCalls)
//                                           ... the map is EMPTY ...
//                                         unlock(m_mu)
//     lock(m_mu); m_pendingCalls[id] = h
//     writeFrame()  -> drops, stopped
//
// The handler is now parked in the pending map of a connection that has already
// been torn down. Nothing will ever take it out: fail() runs once and has been,
// no reply can arrive on a closed socket, and the frame was never written. The
// caller is not told anything.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS THE CALLER, which is the part worth being precise about,
// because "a call is lost" understates it. Every caller of this function has a
// deadline, and the deadline is what answers instead:
//
//   * callMethodAsyncWithError arms a timer before sending, so the user's
//     callback fires — after the FULL timeoutMs — with code "timeout". A
//     connection that is provably gone is reported as a peer that was merely
//     slow, and callers key their retry / re-acquire behaviour off that code.
//   * callMethodWithError blocks its own thread on the future for the whole
//     timeout and reports the same wrong thing.
//   * getMethods() has no caller-supplied timeout at all: it waits out a
//     hard-coded 5 seconds and returns an empty method list.
//
// This predates the io_context fold — master has the identical shape on the
// promise-based path — so it is not a regression of #46; #46's cancelPending()
// only made the orphaned entry self-cleaning rather than permanent.
//
// ── HOW THE INTERLEAVING IS BUILT, rather than waited for ────────────────────
//
// The window is a handful of instructions wide, so these tests place the two
// threads in it instead of racing for it. m_mu is the lever: the test takes the
// connection's own mutex (through the explicit-instantiation access hole
// test_iofold.cpp already uses to read the pending map), which parks the caller
// AFTER its m_stopped check and BEFORE its registration — exactly the gap. The
// test then drops the mutex and calls stop() from the hot thread, while the
// caller is still coming back from a futex wait, so fail() usually reaches the
// mutex first and sweeps a map the caller has not written to yet.
//
// That last handoff is the one part these tests do not control, so nothing is
// asserted about a single round: each runs many and asserts on the aggregate.
// It leans on std::mutex BARGING — a hot thread taking a just-released mutex
// ahead of a waiter the kernel is still waking — which is how both libc++ on
// Darwin (measured: 39-40 of 40 rounds) and glibc's default non-PI mutex behave,
// neither of which promises it. An implementation that instead handed ownership
// straight to the queued waiter would reach the interleaving in NO round, and
// the "was never reached" assertions below are there so that shows up as a
// failure that says exactly that, rather than as four quietly vacuous passes.
//
// Every test asserts that the target interleaving was actually reached at least
// once. Post-fix it is visible in what the call reports — the reclaim answers
// with TRANSPORT_CLOSED / "connection stopped", and that answer is unreachable
// in these rounds by any other route, because the caller demonstrably read
// m_stopped as FALSE (it was parked in the gap before stop() was called at all)
// and so cannot have taken the pre-existing already-stopped early-out. A run in
// which the interleaving was never reached fails, rather than passing quietly.
//
// ── VALIDATED AGAINST THE PRE-FIX TREE ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Per tests/protocol/CMakeLists.txt: a detector is checked by running it on the
// code the fix replaced — a checkout of commit cf1b9b0, the head of #46 — and
// not against a switch, a build option or a getenv() probe in this tree. The
// numbers those runs produced on an aarch64-darwin box are recorded on each
// test below. Summarised: the parking trick reaches the target interleaving in
// 39-40 of 40 rounds, all four tests are RED on cf1b9b0, and they take 159
// seconds there against 9 here — almost all of the difference is callers
// sitting out deadlines that had already been decided.
//
// WHICH OF THESE ARE DETECTORS OF WHAT, because it is not uniform:
//
//   * tests 1-3 detect the DROPPED call. Each is red on cf1b9b0 by a wide
//     margin (40/40 calls never answered; 40/40 answered as "timeout" at
//     828ms; a 5049ms getMethods).
//   * test 4 detects it only weakly — the unaided race is a few instructions
//     wide, and cf1b9b0 loses 14 calls in 10,000. What test 4 is a strong
//     detector of is the DOUBLE, which is the failure the fix could newly
//     introduce; see the note on it.

// The same interleaving one layer up, through callMethodAsyncWithError, which
// is where the cost actually lands: the deadline is the only thing left that
// can resolve the call, so the caller waits it out in full and is then told
// "timeout" — a diagnosis that is not merely imprecise but names the wrong
// party, since the transport knew the connection was gone before the call was
// ever written.
//
// PRE-FIX (cf1b9b0), 40 rounds: all 40 were answered only by the deadline —
// worst 828ms, against the 800ms deadline that validation run used — with code
// "timeout". POST-FIX: 0 reported as a timeout, worst latency 183ms on the
// macos-latest runner and 35ms on an idle local box, which is this test's own
// 30ms parking sleep plus the hop through the Qt loop.
//
// ── WHERE THE BARS ARE SET, after this failed once on a shared CI runner ─────
//
// Run 33637026342 (macos-latest) failed this test on a commit ubuntu-latest
// passed, and four consecutive local runs passed 559/559; nothing on that
// branch touches this path. The bars below are set for a contended runner
// WITHOUT moving the property, which is that the reclaim answers the call and
// the deadline does not:
//
//   * The DEADLINE is 2000ms, not 800ms. Post-fix no round reaches it — the
//     answer arrives ~35ms in — so its size is free, and only a run that is
//     already failing pays for it. What it buys is that a runner must stall for
//     two seconds, not eight hundred milliseconds, to manufacture the "timeout"
//     verdict this test exists to forbid. Pre-fix every round still burns it in
//     full, so re-validating against cf1b9b0 now costs ~80s here, not ~33s.
//   * PROMPTNESS is an absolute 800ms, set off what the mechanism costs on the
//     SLOWEST box measured — worst 183ms on macos-latest, against 35ms locally
//     — and not off the deadline, which has no bearing on it. A fraction of the
//     deadline tracks the wrong quantity: the old kTimeoutMs / 2 left a healthy
//     macos run only 2.2x of headroom, which is the likeliest thing that tripped,
//     and raising the deadline would have loosened the bar for free.
//   * Both bars tolerate 2 of 40 rounds, so one descheduled round is not a red
//     suite. Pre-fix 38-40 of 40 miss them, a ~19x margin. Zero tolerance is
//     kept where it costs nothing: tests 1 and 4 assert unanswered/dropped == 0
//     on counts with no clock in them, and they are the detectors of the drop
//     itself.
//
// Measured under 8x local oversubscription, none of the above is what moves:
// worst latency held at 36-52ms and timedOut at 0, while answered-by-reclaim
// fell from 40 to 18-31 as the mutex handoff lost more often. That counter is
// asserted only to be non-zero — the weakest form that is still not vacuous.

// ── 4. exactly-once, at volume, on the path the fix adds ────────────────────
//
// THE THREE TESTS ABOVE ARE NOT DETECTORS OF EXACTLY-ONCE. Each resolves one
// call once, so each stays green whatever guards the handler — the same trap
// tests/protocol/CMakeLists.txt records for the fold's per-path tests. The fix
// adds a THIRD contender for a registered handler (the post-registration
// reclaim, alongside dispatchIncoming and fail()'s sweep), so the property that
// needs re-proving is that the extract-and-erase under m_mu still lets exactly
// one of them have it.
//
// So: 10,000 calls, registered from four threads, with stop() landing in the
// middle of the burst. Every call counts its own invocations. Both failures are
// counted separately, because they are different bugs — a handler invoked twice
// means the reclaim and the sweep both won, and a handler never invoked is the
// defect this file is about, measured at volume instead of one round at a time.
//
// VALIDATED AS A DOUBLE-DELIVERY DETECTOR, against the obvious spelling of the
// fix rather than an imaginary one: a throwaway checkout in which sendCallAsync
// COPIES its handler into the map and then delivers that copy without the
// extract-and-erase (the "I already have the handler, why look it up" version).
// It reports 4, 6, 7 and 8 doubles per 10,000 over four runs. Thrown away with
// the checkout; nothing in this tree switches it on.
//
// AND WHY IT IS NEEDED AT ALL, given the suite already has a 10,000-call
// release-race: IoFoldTest.ReleaseRacingRepliesInFlightDeliversEachCallOnce is
// BLIND to this path — measured, 0 doubles against the same broken reclaim —
// because it races teardown of the HANDLE against replies while the connection
// stays up, so sendCallAsync's stopped branch is never taken. The contended
// object has to be the connection.
//
// PRE-FIX (cf1b9b0): 14 of the 10,000 calls dropped, and 14 registrations left
// on dead connections — a real but weak signal, since the unaided window is only
// a few instructions wide (tests 1-3 are the wide detectors of the drop).
